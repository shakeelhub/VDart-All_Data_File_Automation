The All Data File Automation project was developed for VDart’s Delivery Excellence team to fully automate the ingestion, cleaning, transformation, validation, and storage of 
high-volume data files. By replacing repetitive manual workflows with a robust automated pipeline, the system drastically
improved processing speed, accuracy, and accessibility, enabling the team to focus on strategic tasks rather than operational bottlenecks.

Python – Core programming language for backend automation due to its rich data processing ecosystem and scalability.

Pandas & NumPy – For high-performance data manipulation, aggregation, and numerical operations.

Openpyxl – For handling complex Excel formats and ensuring data integrity with large workbooks.

Flask – Lightweight web framework for building a custom UI and backend API.

MySQL – Centralized, structured data storage with improved security, indexing, and query performance.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – For an interactive and responsive front-end experience.

Network Hosting – Provided internal access across the organization for all Delivery Excellence team members.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲

Requirement Gathering – Direct discussions with the team to identify repetitive and error-prone tasks.

Solution Design – Backend Python scripts for data cleaning and aggregation + Flask UI for file upload, monitoring, and results.

Agile Development – Short development cycles with iterative testing using real sample data.

Testing & Validation – Focused on robust error handling, data validation, and user-friendly feedback.

Deployment – Hosted on the corporate network for organization-wide accessibility.
